Cartoon README

Handin: This is my final Handin.

Overview: My cartoon has five classes, App, Cartoon, PaneOrganizer, Constants, and Star. They interact
in the following ways:
-the App class creates an instance of the class PaneOrganizer.
- PaneOrganizer creates an instance of my Cartoon class and creates/passes in the panes that are
necessary for the cartoon to function properly
- Cartoon creates an instance variable of my Star class.
- Constants is a public class that every class in my cartoon package can use. It is implemented by
my Cartoon and Star classes.

Design Choices:
- I chose to create an entirely separate class for my moving composite shape because it would decrease
the amount of code in my cartoon class. My star has a lot of components that are much easier to understand
once it is separate from the rest of the cartoon.
